# thesisproject
This repository stores the Unity project used in my thesis regarding color usage in video game text.

Beside the project, a playable build can be found.
In the folder labeled story, the ink files and plain text files containing the story presented in the game, can be found. The plain text pdf contains the Inky syntax, as the story is built with branching paths.
